K09 -- Simple Path of Greatness: answer questions about running a simple web page
2020-10-07

Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
This reminds us of making a new instance of an object in Java. In this case, Flask would be like the object name and app would be like the name of the new instance.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
'/' might refer to the '/' in the path of a directory or the '/' in URLs. It might be used to specify the path where the method's results will be displayed.
After running the file, we noticed that the link to the page is composed of a series of numbers and then the path specified before the function, or '/' here.

Q2: Where will this print to? What will it print?
We think the print(__name__) line will print the name of the module being run, in this case, __main__, to the terminal where this program was run. 

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
We think that this will appear on the webpage that shows up when this file is run because it is being returned by the function whose result will be displayed on the page.

Q4: Where have you seen similar constructs in other languages?
This reminds us of calling methods in Java, with the dot operator being used to call the run method on the instance called app.
