K28: Bubble Bubble Toil Trouble
2021-05-13

v1:
- prediction: clicking on a word will result in a popup of the word
- observation: the click did produce a popup of the word 
- reads the td tag and creates an alert accordingly

v2:
- prediction: popups will occur one after another
    - the full table will be displayed last because it is written last
- observation: the first popup was the item, then the row, then the full table

v3:
- prediction: stopPropagation() stops the popups after one is produced
    - only table will be shown
- before uncommenting: first popup was the table, then the cell, then the row
- after uncommenting: only the table popup is produced after stopPropagation() is called 
    - when table.addEventListener is set to false, the table popup is produced last

v4:
- prediction: the order will not be impacted 
    - event.stopPropagation() will ensure that only one popoup is produced
- before uncommenting: the first popup is the table, then the row, then the item
    - capturing instead of bubbling
- after uncommenting: event.stopPropagation() prevented further popups from occuring after table
    -  when addEventListener is set to true, the order of popups is table, row, item
    - when addEventListener is set to false for all of them, the roder is reversed
        - order of popups is item, row, table
