}
Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.
Value - data related to a given identifier.
Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.
Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.
