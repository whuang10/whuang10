Winnie’s Workshop
- Really nice and concise way of picking a random weighted occupation using random.choice
- Also added an option of having no job to address the missing 0.2%

Renee’s Workshop
- Used a longer method to pick a random weighted occupation
- Picked a random number from 0 to 99.8 and subtracted each occupation’s percentage from it until it became negative

Anya’s Workshop
- Separated code into different methods and used a lot of comments to explain everything clearly
- Used open method to read in the csv and then manipulated each line to pick out info
- Similar method as Renee’s group to pick occupation

Amelia’s Workshop
- Similar method of creating dictionary as Anya’s group
- Also used random.choice like Winnie
- Had a lot of comments to explain their code

Pak’s Workshop
- Separated the file into an array first and then moves relevant info into a dictionary
- Converted percentages to ranges and then compares a random number to each range to pick random occupation
- Has a step to make sure the all the percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth
- Seems like a very Java based approach
