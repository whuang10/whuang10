K12 -- ...or The Only Constant is Change?: Basic jinja and templates
2020-10-13

#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line? 
NameError occurs since the name of the method render_template in app.py is not defined without 
the import. 

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Yes :)

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?

    'model_tmplt.html': tells flask which file in the templates folder to load. 

    foo="fooooo": it tells the template the value to put in place of {{foo}} when loading the file. 

    collection=coll: (coll = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]) sends the list of numbers coll to the template so that 
    it can run the for loop and display the numbers in a list. 

Questions: How come flask requires keywords such as templates or static as folder names?
            (probably one of the main elements of the framework, so that you need to take
            less steps yourself to find the files needed, built in structure documented in
            the flask documentation)

Extra Notes: You need to indicate the end of the for loop in jinja using  {% endfor %}
